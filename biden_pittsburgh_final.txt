GOOD AFTERNOON. I WANT TO THINK CARNEGIE MELLON FOR PROVIDING THIS SPACE AND ALL THE PROMISE IT HOLDS FOR FUTURE JOBS AND -- IN THE HIGH-TECH WORLD. IN RECENT DAYS, WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF TALK ABOUT HOW I HAVE DECIDED TO COME TO PITTSBORO TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW. IN THE EARLY DAYS OF WORLD WAR II, FOR THEM ROOSEVELT TOLD THE COUNTRY THE NEWS IS GOING TO GET WORSE AND WORSE BEFORE IT GETS BETTER AND BETTER. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO HAVE IT STRAIGHT FROM THE SHOULDER. STRAIGHT FROM THE SHOULDER. THE JOB OF A PRESIDENT IS TO TELL IT STRAIGHT FROM THE SHOULDER, TELL THE TRUTH. TO BE CANDID, TO FACE FACTS, TO LEAD, NOT TO INCITE. THAT IS WHY I AM SPEAKING TO YOU TODAY. THE INCUMBENT PRESIDENT IS INCAPABLE OF TELLING US THE TRUTH, INCAPABLE OF FACING THE FACTS AND INCAPABLE OF HEALING. HE DOES NOT WANT TO SHED LIGHT, HE WANTS TO GENERATE HEAT. HE IS STOKING VIOLENCE IN OUR CITIES. THIS IS A TRAGIC FACT OF THE MATTER ABOUT HIS PERILOUS OUR. -- ABOUT THIS PERILOUS HOUR. WE HAVE SEEN AGAIN AND AGAIN, UNWARRANTED POLICE SHOOTING, EXCESSIVE FORCE. SEVEN BULLETS TO THE BACK OF JACOB BLAKE. VIOLENCE OF EXTREMISTS AND OPPORTUNISTS, RIGHT-WING MILITIAS, WHITE SUPREMACISTS, VIGILANTES, WHO INFILTRATE PROTEST. HOPING TO WREAK HAVOC AND TO DERAIL ANY HOPE OF PROGRESS. I WANT TO BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR, LET'S BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT ALL THIS. WRITING IS NOT PROTESTING -- RIOTING IS NOT PROTESTING, SETTING FIRES IS NOT PROTESTING. NONE OF THIS IS PROTESTING. IT IS LAWLESSNESS, PLAIN AND SIMPLE. THOSE WHO DO IT SHOULD BE PROSECUTED. VIOLENCE WILL NOT BRING CHANGE. IT WILL ONLY BRING DESTRUCTION. IT IS WRONG IN EVERY WAY. IT DIVIDES INSTEAD OF UNITES. THIS ONLY HURTS THE WORKING FAMILIES THAT SERVE THE COMMUNITY. IT MAKES THINGS WORSE ACROSS THE BOARD, NOT BETTER. IT IS NOT WHAT DR. KING OR JOHN LEWIS TAUGHT. IT MUST END. FIRES ARE BURNING AND WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO FANS THE FLAMES RATHER THAN FIGHTING THE FLAMES. WE MUST NOT BURN, WE HAVE TO BUILD. THIS PRESIDENT LONG AGO FORFEITED ANY MORAL LEADERSHIP. HE CANNOT STOP THE VIOLENCE BECAUSE FOR YEARS HE HAS FOMENTED IT. HE MAY BELIEVE THAT MOUTHING THE WORDS LAW AND ORDER MAKES HIM STRONG. BUT HIS FAILURE TO CALL ON HIS OWN SUPPORTERS TO STOP ACTING AS AN ARMED MILITIA IN THIS COUNTRY SHOWS HOW WEAK HE IS. DOES ANYONE BELIEVE THERE WILL BE LESS VIOLENCE IN AMERICA IF DONALD TRUMP IS REELECTED? WE NEED JUSTICE IN AMERICA. WE NEED SAFETY IN AMERICA. WE ARE FACING CRISES THAT KEPT MULTIPLYING. COVID, ECONOMIC DEMONSTRATION, UNWARRANTED POLICE VIOLENCE. IN BOLDING -- EMBOLDENING WHITE NATIONALISTS. THERE IS NO REASON WHY WE CAN'T JUST DO SO MUCH MORE THAT WE ARE DOING -- THEN WE ARE DOING. THE COMMON THREAD IS THE INCUMBENT PRESIDENT WHO MAKES THINGS WORSE, NOT BETTER. THE INCUMBENT PRESIDENT WHO SOWS CHAOS RATHER THAN PROVIDING ORDER. AN INCUMBENT PRESIDENT WHO FAILS IN THE BASIC DUTY OF THE JOB. THAT IS TO ADVANCE THE TRUTH THAT ALL OF US KNOW. WE ARE ALL BORN WITH THE RIGHT TO LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. THAT IS RIGHT, ALL OF US. THE MOMS AND DADS IN SCRANTON WHERE I GREW UP WHO HAVE WORKED AND SCRIPT FOR EVERYTHING THEY HAVE EVER GOTTEN IN LIFE. THE AUTOWORKER IN MICHIGAN WHO MAKES -- WHO STOMACHS THE BEST IN THE WORLD. THE SINGLE MOM IN OHIO MAKING -- A SINGLE MOM IN OHIO WORKING THREE JOBS TO STAY AFLOAT WHO WILL DO ANYTHING FOR HER CHILD, RETIRED VETERAN IN FLORIDA WHO GAVE EVERYTHING HE HAD TO THIS COUNTRY AND NOW JUST WANTS US TO HONOR THE PROMISES MADE TO HIM. THE LORD & TAYLOR SALESPERSON WHO JUST LOST THEIR JOB, A STORE CLOSING AFTER 194 YEARS. NURSES AND DOCTORS IN WISCONSIN WHO HAVE SEEN SO MUCH SICKNESS AND DEATH, AND THEY WONDER HOW MUCH MORE CAN THEY TAKE, BUT STILL THEY MUSTER UP THE COURAGE TO TAKE THEIR OF THOSE IN THIS -- TAKE CARE OF THOSE PATIENTS IN THIS PANDEMIC WHILE RISKING THEIR OWN LIVES. RESEARCHERS IN MINNESOTA WHO WOKE UP THIS MORNING DETERMINED TO FIND A BREAKTHROUGH IN TREATING CANCER. THEY WILL DO THE SAME THING TOMORROW AND THE DAY AFTER AND THE DAY AFTER BECAUSE SHE WILL NEVER GIVE UP. WHITE, BLACK, LATINO, ASIAN AMERICAN, NATIVE AMERICANS, EVERYBODY. I AM IN THIS CAMPAIGN FOR YOU, NO MATTER YOUR COLOR, ZIP CODE, POLITICS. WHEN I THINK OF THE PRESIDENCY, I DON'T THINK ABOUT MYSELF, IT IS NOT ABOUT MY BRAND, IT IS ABOUT YOU. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE CAN DO BETTER, WE HAVE TO DO BETTER. I PROMISE YOU THAT WE WILL DO BETTER. THE ROAD BACK BEGINS NOW IN THIS CAMPAIGN. YOU KNOW ME. YOU KNOW MY HEART. YOU KNOW MY STORY, MY FAMILY STORY. ASK YOURSELF IF I LOOK LIKE A RADICAL SOCIALIST WITH A SOFT SPOT FOR RIOTERS? REALLY? I WANT TO SAVE AMERICA, SAY FROM COVID, SAFE FROM CRIME AND LOOTING. SAFE FROM RACIALLY MOTIVATED VIOLENCE, SAFE FROM BAD COPS. LET ME BE CRYSTAL CLEAR. SAFE FROM FOUR MORE YEARS OF DONALD TRUMP. I LOOK AT THIS VIOLENCE AND I SEE LIVES AND COMMUNITIES AND THE DREAMS OF SMALL BUSINESSES BEING DESTROYED. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR REAL PROGRESS IN THE ISSUES OF RACE AND POLICE REFORM, JUSTICE BEING PUT TO THE TEST. DONALD TRUMP LOOKS AT THIS VIOLENCE AND SEES A POLITICAL LIFELINE. HAVING FAILED TO PROTECT THIS NATION FROM THE VIRUS, IT HAS KILLED MORE THAN 180,000 AMERICANS SO FAR. TRUMP POSTED IN ALL CAPS -- AN ALL CAPS TWEET TO SAVE HIS CAMPAIGN. SHE COMES OUT AS HAS A, THE MORE CHAOS, VIOLENCE, THE BETTER IT IS FOR TRUMP'S REELECTION. JUST THINK ABOUT THAT. THIS IS A SITTING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE PROTECTING THIS COUNTRY BUT INSTEAD, HE IS ROOTING FOR CHAOS AND VIOLENCE. THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS DONALD TRUMP FAILED TO PROTECT AMERICA. SINCE THEY CAN'T RUN ON THE RECORD, WE WILL SEE MORE AMERICAN DEATH TO A VIRUS, THIS VIRUS THAN THE NATION HAS SUFFERED IN EVERY WAR SINCE KOREA COMBINED. SINCE THEY CAN'T RUN ON THEIR ECONOMY, THAT HAS SEEN MORE PEOPLE LOSE THEIR JOBS THAN ANY TIME SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. SINCE THEY CAN'T RUN ON THE SIMPLE PROPOSITION OF SENDING OUR CHILDREN SAFELY BACK TO SCHOOL. SINCE THEY HAVE NO AGENDA OR VISION FOR A SECOND TERM. TRUMP AND PENTZ ARE RUNNING ON THIS, I FIND IT FASCINATING. IT WON'T BE SAFE IN JOE BIDEN'S AMERICA. WHAT IS THERE PROOF? THE VIOLENCE WE ARE SEEING IN DONALD TRUMP'S AMERICA. THESE ARE NOT IMAGES OF SOME IMAGINED JOE BIDEN AMERICA OF THE FUTURE, THESE ARE IMAGES OF DONALD TRUMP'S AMERICA TODAY. HE KEEPS SAYING IF HE WAS PRESIDENT THAT WOULD NOT HAPPEN, YOU WOULD FEEL SAFE. WILL HE IS PRESIDENT WHETHER HE KNOWS IT OR NOT. IT IS HAPPENING. IT IS GETTING WORSE. YOU KNOW WHY. DONALD TRUMP ADDS FUEL TO EVERY FIRE. HE REFUSES TO EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A RACIAL JUSTICE PROBLEM IN AMERICA. HE WON'T STAND UP TO ANY FORM OF VIOLENCE. HE HAS NO PROBLEM WITH RIGHT WING MILITIAS. OFTEN BETTER ARMED THAN THE POLICE, OFTEN IN THE MIDDLE OF VIOLENCE. AND BECAUSE TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS DON'T TRUST THIS PRESIDENT TO RESPECT THEIR RIGHTS, TO HEAR THEIR CONCERNS OR TO PROTECT THEM. IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I WERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND WE HAD TO DEFEND FEDERAL PROPERTY. WE DID IT, WE DID NOT SEE IT -- YOU DID NOT CS WHIPPING UP FEARS AROUND THE DEPLOYMENT OF SECRET FEDERAL TRUCE. -- TROOPS. WE JUST DID OUR JOB. WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I WERE IN OFFICE, WE DID NOT LOOK AT CITIES AS DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN RUN, THESE ARE AMERICAN CITIES. TRUMP DOES NOT SEE HIMSELF AS PRESIDENT FOR ALL AMERICANS. FRANKLY, I BELIEVE IF I WERE PRESIDENT TODAY, THE COUNTRY WOULD BE SAFER AND WE WOULD BE SEEING A LOT LESS VIOLENCE. HERE IS WHY. I SAID WE MUST ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF RACIAL INJUSTICE. I PERSONALLY SPOKE TO GEORGE FLOYD'S FAMILY AND JACOB BLAKE'S FAMILY. I KNOW THEIR PAIN AND SO DO YOU. I KNOW THE JUSTICE THEY SEEK AND SO DO YOU. THEY TOLD US NONE OF THIS VIOLENCE RESPECTS OR HONORS GEORGE OR JACOB. I BELIEVE WE CAN BRING THESE PEOPLE FIGHTING FOR RACIAL INJUSTICE TO THE TABLE. I WORKED WITH POLICE IN THIS COUNTRY FOR MANY YEARS. I KNOW THAT MOST COPS ARE GOOD, DECENT PEOPLE. I KNOW HOW THEY RISK THEIR LIVES EVERY TIME THEY PUT THAT SHIELD ON AND LOCK THE DOOR. I AM CONFIDENT THAT I CAN BRING THE POLICE TO THE TABLE AS WELL. I WOULD MAKE SURE THAT EVERY MAYOR AND GOVERNOR HAD THE SUPPORT THEY NEEDED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BUT, I WOULD NOT BE LOOKING TO USE THE UNITED STATES MILITARY AGAINST THEIR OWN PEOPLE. IF I WERE PRESIDENT, MY LANGUAGE WOULD BE LESS DIVISIVE. I WOULD BE LOOKING TO LOWER THE TEMPERATURE IN THIS COUNTRY, NOT RAISE IT. I WOULD BE LOOKING TO UNITE THE NATION. BUT LOOK, IF DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO ASK THE QUESTION OF WHO WILL KEEP YOU SAFE OR AS PRESIDENT? BUT AFTER THAT QUESTION. FIRST, SOME SIMPLE FACTS. WHEN I WAS VICE PRESIDENT, FILED -- VIOLENT CRIME FELL 15% IN THIS COUNTRY. THEY DID IT WITHOUT CHAOS -- WE DID IT WITHOUT CHAOS AND WITHOUT DISORDER ORDER. AND YES, WE DID IT WITH DEMOCRATIC MAYORS AND MOST OF THE CDS -- MAJOR CITIES IN THIS COUNTRY. THE MURDER RATE IS UP UNDER DONALD TRUMP. YOU REALLY FEEL SAFER UNDER DONALD TRUMP? COVID HAS TAKEN THIS YEAR -- IT HAS TAKEN MORE THAN -- MORE LIES THIS YEAR THAN ANY OTHER YEAR FOR THE LAST 100 YEARS. MORE THAN 180,000 LIES IN JUST SIX MONTHS. AN AVERAGE OF A THOUSAND PEOPLE DYING PER WEEK IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST. IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT FEAR, DINO IT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF IN AMERICA? THEY ARE AFRAID THEY ARE GOING TO GET COVID. THEY ARE AFRAID THEY ARE GOING TO GET SICK AND DIE. THAT IS IN NO SMALL PART BECAUSE OF YOU. WE ARE NOW ON TRACK FOR MORE THAN 200,000 DEATHS IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE OF COVID. MORE THAN 100,000 SENIORS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES IN THE VIRUS. MORE COPS HAVE DIED FROM COVID THIS YEAR THAN HAVE BEEN KILLED ON PATROL. NEARLY ONE IN SIX SMALL BUSINESSES CLOSED IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY. DO YOU REALLY FEEL SAFER UNDER TRUMP? WHAT ABOUT TRUMP'S PLAN TO DESTROY THE FEDERAL CARE ACT? PROTECTIONS FOR PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, IT IMPACTS MORE THAN 100 MILLION AMERICANS. DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL SAFER? HOW ABOUT TRUMP'S PLAN TO DEFUND SOCIAL SECURITY? SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S CHIEF ACTUARY JUST RELIEF -- RELEASED A REPORT SAYING IF TRUMP'S PLAN GOES INTO EFFECT, THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FORM WOULD BE "PERMANENTLY DEPLETED BY THE MIDDLE OF CALENDAR YEAR 2023, WITH NO ABILITY TO PAY BENEFITS THEREAFTER." TO PUT IT PLAINLY, TRUMPS PLAN WOULD WIPE OUT SOCIAL SECURITY, PERIOD. DO YOU FEEL SAFER AND MORE SECURE NOW? THE FEAR THAT REIGNS UNDER THIS PRESIDENT DOES NOT STOP AT OUR SHORES. THE KREMLIN HAS PUT BOUNTIES ON THE HEADS OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS. INSTEAD OF TELLING VLADIMIR PUTIN THAT THERE WILL BE NO PUTTING UP WITH THIS, THAT THERE WILL BE A HEAVY PRICE TO PLAY IF HE TOUCHES AN AMERICAN SOLDIER, THIS PRESIDENT DOES I EVEN BRING UP THE SUBJECT IN HIS MOBILE PHONE CALL WITH PUTIN. A REPORT THAT THE RUSSIAN FORCES JUST ATTACKED AMERICAN FORCES IN SYRIA, INJURING OUR SERVICEMEMBERS. DID YOU HEAR THE PRESIDENT SAY A SINGLE WORD? DID HE LIFT ONE FINGER NEVER BEFORE HAS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT PAID SUCH A SUBSERVIENT ROLE TO RUSSIAN LEADERS. IT'S NOT ONLY DANGEROUS, IT'S HUMILIATING AND EMBARRASSING FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD TO SEE IT WEAKENS US. NOT EVEN AMERICAN TROOPS CAN FEEL SAFER UNDER TRUMP. DONALD TRUMP'S ROLE AS A BYSTANDER IN HIS OWN PRESIDENCY EXTENDS THE ECONOMIC PLAN AND PAIN. THE PLANNING DOESN'T HAVE IN THE PAIN BEING FELT BY MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. HE SAID THIS WEEK, "YOU BETTER VOTE FOR ME OR YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE THE GREATEST DEPRESSION YOU HAVE EVER SEEN." DOES HE NOT UNDERSTAND AND SEE THAT TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO LOVE HAD TO FILE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT THIS YEAR SO FAR? THAT PEOPLE WON'T BE ABLE TO MAKE NEXT MONTH'S RENT PAYMENT. THE PEOPLE WHO LOST WAGES OVER COST OF GROCERIES GOING UP DRAMATICALLY. PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I STOPPED THE DEPRESSION IN 2009. WE TOOK A BAD ECONOMY THAT WAS FALLING AND TURNED IT AROUND. TRUMP TOOK A GOOD ECONOMY AND DROVE IT BACK INTO THE DITCH. THROUGH HIS FAILURE TO GET COVID UNDER CONTROL, HIS FAILURE TO PULL TOGETHER THE LEADERS IN CONGRESS, HIS FAILURE TO DELIVER REAL RELIEF TO WORKING PEOPLE HAS MADE OUR COUNTRY ECONOMIC SITUATION SO MUCH WORSE, SO MUCH WORSE THAN IT HAD TO BE. WE TALK ABOUT SAFETY AND SECURITY, WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THE SIX SECURITY AND BEING ABLE TO LOOK YOUR CHILD IN THE EYE AND TELL THEM EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OK. DON'T WORRY, WE WILL NOT LOSE OUR HOME. WE WILL PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. IT'S GOING TO BE OK. THAT'S THE JOB OF THE PRESIDENT. I'VE LAID OUT AN AGENDA FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY THAT WILL RESTORE SOCIAL SECURITY FOR WORKING FAMILIES. WE WON'T JUST BUILDINGS BACK THE WAY THEY WERE BEFORE, WE WILL BUILD THEM BACK THAT HER. WITH GOOD PAYING DROPS -- JOBS. WITH INVESTMENTS IN OUR HEALTH CARE AND CHILD CARE WORKERS SO THEY GET THE PAY IN DIGNITY THEY DESERVE. WHILE USING A FINANCIAL BURDEN ON MILLIONS OF FAMILIES. WITH THE CLEAN ENERGY STRATEGY THAT HAS A PLACE FOR THE ENERGY WORKERS RIGHT HERE IN WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA. I AM NOT BANNING FRACTION -- FRACKING. I AM NOT BANNING FRACKING NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES DONALD TRUMP WISE ABOUT ME -- LIES ABOUT ME. THE FUTURE IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. WE HEAR DONALD TRUMP SELF-CENTERED RANT AND RISKS. THE VOICE OF AMERICANS SHOULD BE HEARD. THE ONE YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO HIS JULIA JACKSON, THE MOTHER OF JACOB BLAKE. THE VOICE OF COURAGE, CHARACTER AND WISDOM. LOOKING AT THE DAMAGE THAT HAS BEEN DONE IN HER CITY, SHE SAID "THE VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION DOES NOT REFLECT THE SUN OR MY FAMILY. THESE OTHER WORDS OF A MOM, A MOTHER WHOSE SON HAD JUST BEEN SHOT SEVEN TIMES IN FRONT OF HIS CHILDREN. BADLY WOMEN PARALYZED, PERHAPS PERMANENTLY. EVEN -- BADLY WOUNDED, PARALYZED, PERHAPS PERMANENTLY. SHE IS PLEADING FOR THIS NATION TO HEAL. SHE SAID SHE WAS PRAYING FOR HER SON. THEN SHE SAID SOMETHING TO ME THAT SURPRISED ME. SHE SAID SHE WAS PRAYING FOR ALL POLICE OFFICERS. SHE HAS ALREADY BEEN PLAYING -- PRAYING FOR AMERICA EVEN BEFORE HER SON WAS SHOT. SHE HAS PUBLICLY ASKED ALL OF US TO EXAMINE OUR HEARTS. CITIZENS, ELECTED OFFICIALS, POLICE, ALL OF US. THEN SHE SAID THIS, "WE NEED HEALING." MORE THAN ANYTHING. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO AS A NATION. WE NEED TO HEAL. THE CURRENT PRESIDENT WANTS YOU TO LIVE IN FEAR. HE ADVERTISES HIMSELF AS A FIGURE OF ORDER. HE ISN'T. HE HAS NOT BEEN PART OF THE SOLUTION THUS FAR. HE IS PART OF THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM THAT I WILL BE YOU MY ALL RESOLVED TO STOP. I WILL DEAL WITH THE VIRUS. I WILL DEAL WITH THE ECONOMIC CRISIS. ITHE PROBLEM THAT I WILL WORK TO BRING EQUALITY AND OPPORTUNITY TO EVERYONE. WE'VE ARRIVED AT A MOMENT IN THIS CAMPAIGN WHERE WE ALL KNOW, EVEN THE PRESS WILL WORK TO BRING EQUALITY AND IN FRONT OF ME, KNEW WE WOULD GET TO. THE MOMENT WHEN DONALD TRUMP WOULD BE SO DESPERATE HE WOULD DO ANYTHING TO HOLD ONTO POWER. DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN A TOXIC PRESENCE IN OUR NATION FOR FOUR YEARS. POISONING HOW WE TALK TO ONE ANOTHER. POISONING HOW WE TREAT ONE ANOTHER. POISONING THE VALUES THIS NATION HAS ALWAYS HELD DEAR. POISONING OUR VERY DEMOCRACY. NOW, IN JUST A LITTLE OVER 60 DAYS, WE HAVE A DECISION TO MAKE. WILL WE RID OURSELVES OF THIS TOXIN? OR WILL WE MAKE A PERMANENT PART -- MAKE IT A PERMANENT PART OF OUR NATION'S CHARACTER? AS AMERICANS, I AM CONFIDENT WE BELIEVE IN HONESTY AND DECENCY. TREATING EVERYONE WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. GIVING EVERYONE A FAIR SHOT. LEAVING NO ONE BEHIND. GIVING HATE NO SAFE HARBOR, AND DEMONIZING NO ONE. WE ALWAYS RECOGNIZE THERE IS SOMETHING BIGGER THAN OURSELVES. TRUMP DOES NOT SEEM TO BELIEVE IN ANY OF THAT. AMERICA IS AN IDEA. IT'S THE MOST POWERFUL IDEA IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. I BELIEVE IT SPEAKS TO THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL. IN THE DIRT -- AND THEY DESERVE TO BE TREATED EQUALLY. TRUMP HAS SOUGHT TO REMAKE THIS NATION IN HIS IMAGE, SELFISH, ANGRY, DARK AND DIVISIVE. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE. AT OUR BEST, AMERICA'S ALWAYS BEEN, AND IF I HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT, IT WILL BE AGAIN GENEROUS, AND OPTIMISTIC NATION FULL OF HOPE AND RESOLVE. DONALD TRUMP IS DETERMINED TO INSTILL FEAR IN AMERICA. THAT'S WHAT HIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN COMES DOWN TO. FEAR. I BELIEVE AMERICA IS STRONGER THAN THAT. I BELIEVE WE WILL BE GUIDED BY THE WORDS OF POPE JOHN PAUL II. WORDS DRAWN FROM SCRIPTURE. BE NOT AFRAID. BE NOT AFRAID. FEAR NEVER BUILDS THE FUTURE, BUT HOPE DOES. AND BUILDING THE FUTURE IS WHAT AMERICA DOES, WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS DONE. IT'S WHAT WE HAVE ALWAYS DONE BEST AND CONTINUE TO DO BEST. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE THING BEYOND OUR CAPACITY WHEN WE DECIDE TO DO IT TOGETHER. SO LET'S GET TOGETHER. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. MAY GOD BLESS YOU. MAY GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS.
